Detrend fluorescence microscopy image series for fluorescence
fluctuation and correlation spectroscopy (FCS and FFS) analysis. This
package contains functionality published in a 2016 paper
<https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx434> but it has been extended
since then with the *Robin Hood* algorithm and thus contains unpublished
work.

## Installation

You can install the release version of `detrendr` from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=detrendr) with:

``` r
install.packages("detrendr")
```

You can install the (unstable) development version of `detrendr` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/rorynolan/detrendr/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("rorynolan/detrendr")
```

I highly recommend using the release version. The dev version is just
for the ultra-curious and should be thought of as unreliable.

## How to use the package
